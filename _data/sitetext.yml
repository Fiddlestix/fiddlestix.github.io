    title: "About"
    text: "Howdy, I'm Anthony Donovan"
    body: "I’ve always been fascinated with music ever since I was a little kid. The idea of custom guitar bodies came from when my uncle and I decided to build my dream guitar, a tele, with his CNC machine. The project was a success and I realized it was something I really liked doing. So I decided to start Anthony Donovan Guitars to make other musicians’ dream guitars a reality too."
