    desc: I’ve been fascinated with music ever since I was a little kid. The idea of custom guitar bodies came from when my uncle and I decided to build my dream guitar, a tele, with his CNC machine. The project was a success and I realized it was something I really liked doing. So I decided to start Anthony Donovan Guitars to give other musicians a chance to own an affordable custom instrument.

Would it have just your signature on the head or would it have 3 necks, 11 pickups, and a built in overdrive pedal? Since I do everything on a small scale I can make it exactly how you want it."
